        <h2>Artist Statement</h2> <!--This may be moved to the More about Me subpage-->
        <p>From a young age my family has regarded me as a stongly tactile person.
            Experiencing reality to a certain degree through my hands.
            It is from this body part from which most of my art has orignated.
            For this reason I was particularly drawn towards the world of art because I could create something I
            experinced using my hands and eysight.
            When I create art I strive and sometimes struggle to create a piece that is inspired by the balence and
            aesthetic quality between simplicty and complexity.
            When I find these represented in reality and see a dreamlike, perhaps maybe bold or flashy, indescribable
            quality I am often drawn towards it.
            Through art I often try to recreate this, and the feelings of mystery, wonder, joy or deep emotion that I
            feel as a result.
        </p>
        <p>The kind of art media(s) that I particularly specialize in are probably:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drawing</li>
            <li>Acrylic Painting</li>
            <li>Creative Writing</li>
            <li>Amatuer Photography</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have also practiced/worked in the following medias:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ceramics</li>
            <li>Sculpture</li>
            <li>Printmaking</li>
            <li>Bookarts</li>
            <li>Glass fusing</li>
            <li></li> <!-- ADD more Art Media to the list-->
