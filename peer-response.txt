Corey, You have a great website and i cant wait to see when it's complete. 
Your website background colors look good, i love the font style used and also how you were able to link your page to other websites. 
One thing and in a very respectful way....Try to fix the PAGE TITLE that when you scroll down the page, the title don't disappear. 
And it looks like UNDER CONSTRUCTION is your page title i was suggesting if you can put a title that tells all about your website 
and maybe make the title font-size bigger and bold. 
great job on using the media, when i resized/maximized your page breaks all evenly and looks much better than when it's maximized. 
I loved also how you used your menus which makes your page stand out from other pages. 
ABOUT ME is the menu that captured my attention i will be honesty and say that that section looks perfect because you have the sides, 
the description about you and the title which have different colors.
Nice work on that section. Other than that.......good job and i cant wait to see your website when it's complete.


The above text is from my peer Robert Serembe. 
My understanding of his critique for my website is a little limited. 
His comments either highlight his positive viewpoint of my website, or intentianally butter me up.
From what I could see there was only one piece of critizism:

"One thing and in a very respectful way....Try to fix the PAGE TITLE that when you scroll down the page, the title don't disappear."

Which I assume he is refering to the navagation bar and wants it to be sticky?
I will try to involve this into my website, but honestly I might have my work cut out for me.

(Self Critique)
I will also be working on the content and content formatting, because that is the #1 critique I have for my website at this point.
Also, I am really running out of time at this point, which is like being broke when you need to buy something. 
So I need to be realistic.


The Results: 

I thankfully figured out how to get my navbar sticky, after a long while, however it was still created faster than expected.
Unfortunately, it is not perfect, because certain parts still need fixing. For example: the dropdown button goes over the navbar as you scroll. 
Which thankfully is not that noticable.

I Fixed the format of my image gallery and filled it with some content.(For Self Critique)


Extra Credit:
I added a table at the bottom of my "Contact" page.


I found a way to add a basic favicon using:

If I had more time I would mess with the colors more.
