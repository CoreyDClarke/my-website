            <h1>Breakdown Of How I Develop Creative Pieces</h1>
            <div class="box-color">
                <h2>Thought Process:</h2>
                <h3>Step 1: Starting point</h3>
                <p>Whenever I start a piece I generally start using one of three starting points. They are ordered
                    by
                    general effectivness, how easy or difficult they are to work with, and how much time is consumed
                    in
                    the
                    overall proccess.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Start From a Prexisting Idea.</h3>
                        <p>This starting point is the most efficient way to create a worthwhile piece that provides
                            the
                            best
                            level of motivation, least amount of development time, and a higher probability of
                            creative
                            success. What differs from the other two, is that you have a fraction of the plan for
                            your
                            art thought out before you attempt to make the piece. Often times at this point you may
                            have
                            an almost complete plan.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Improvized Start</h3>
                        <p>This starting point can vary in effecincy, but is a common start that many creative
                            pieces
                            start from. Often times you may find/think of a decent idea relating to your piece, but
                            have
                            only just started developing your plan.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Lack of Creative Spark</h3>
                        <p>If you are an artist, or are working on developing an idea, this staring point is the
                            worst,
                            most nightmarish start you can have. If you are lacking time, avoid this like the
                            plague,
                            unless you have no other choice. At this point your are very unlikly to develop anything
                            worthwhile. When you are at this stage, absolutly no ideas are forming in your brain for
                            an
                            extended length of time. When this happens it is more effective to work with a new idea.
                            This commonly occurs when you are working with a prompt/idea that someone else devised
                            and
                            it does not speak to you for some reason or anouther. Although this starting point is
                            often
                            frustrating, its defining factors make it a very good way to practice creativity and
                            challenge oneself to the limit.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Step 2: Stick to a Plan or Branch Out</h3>
                <p>I choose a specific path from my devised plan, or I think of new ways I can make slight
                    alterations
                    to my orignial idea. Sometimes this step is already completed in the previous step. However,
                    even if
                    you have already planned a differnt branch or secondary idea most can branch out further.</p>
