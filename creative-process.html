                <h1>Breakdown Of How I Develop Creative Pieces</h1>
                <div class="box-color">
                    <h2>Thought Process:</h2>
                    <h3>Step 1: Starting point</h3>
                    <p>Whenever I start a piece I generally start using one of three starting points. They are ordered
                        by
                        general effectivness, how easy or difficult they are to work with, and how much time is consumed
                        in
                        the
                        overall proccess.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Start From a Prexisting Idea.</h3>
                            <p>This starting point is the most efficient way to create a worthwhile piece that provides
                                the
                                best
                                level of motivation, least amount of development time, and a higher probability of
                                creative
                                success. What differs from the other two, is that you have a fraction of the plan for
                                your
                                art thought out before you attempt to make the piece. Often times at this point you may
                                have
                                an almost complete plan.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Improvized Start</h3>
                            <p>This starting point can vary in effecincy, but is a common start that many creative
                                pieces
                                start from. Often times you may find/think of a decent idea relating to your piece, but
                                have
                                only just started developing your plan.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Lack of Creative Spark</h3>
                            <p>If you are an artist, or are working on developing an idea, this staring point is the
                                worst,
                                most nightmarish start you can have. If you are lacking time, avoid this like the
                                plague,
                                unless you have no other choice. At this point your are very unlikly to develop anything
                                worthwhile. When you are at this stage, absolutly no ideas are forming in your brain for
                                an
                                extended length of time. When this happens it is more effective to work with a new idea.
                                This commonly occurs when you are working with a prompt/idea that someone else devised
                                and
                                it does not speak to you for some reason or anouther. Although this starting point is
                                often
                                frustrating, its defining factors make it a very good way to practice creativity and
                                challenge oneself to the limit.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Step 2: Stick to a Plan or Branch Out</h3>
                    <p>I choose a specific path from my devised plan, or I think of new ways I can make slight
                        alterations
                        to my orignial idea. Sometimes this step is already completed in the previous step. However,
                        even if
                        you have already planned a differnt branch or secondary idea most can branch out further.</p>
